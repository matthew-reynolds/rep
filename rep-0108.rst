Abstract
========

This REP describes the variants for the ROS Diamondback release.
These new variants establish new entry points for the ROS installation
process and provide organization of the ROS stack ecosystem.

Motivation
==========

ROS variants provide several roles for the ROS distributions: 

 * installation entry points for users
 * installation entry points for robot configuration
 * organize related stacks
 * identity for institutions releasing stacks.

The ROS C Turtle distribution defined three main variants: `base`,
`pr2`, and `pr2all`.  These variants were originally established in
the ROS Box Turtle release, when there were approximately only 30
stacks.  Since then, the number of stacks has quadrupled to over 120.
The number of institutions releasing stacks has also grown from one to
seven.  This growth, both in code and the ROS developer base, requires
re-evaluation of the current variant configuration.

The growth of ROS and the related variants has also lead to the
perception that ROS is bloated: users are not immediately aware that
minimal configurations are possible.  Similarly, effort was made
during the ROS Diamondback development cycle to separate GUI
dependencies into separate stacks; this enables new, lighter-weight,
GUI-less variants.  

Although a new user should be exposed to the wealth of libraries and
tools available in ROS, we wish to make the user aware when they are
choosing "bloated" configurations.  GUI-less variants also enable
lighter-weight "on robot" configurations, as well as easier porting of
common ROS configurations to other platforms.

Finally, with the ROS distributions containing stacks from more
institutions, we wish to start exploring making it easier for
institutions to promote their identity and have their own
configurations, such as institution-specific or robot-specific setups.

Uses of Variants
----------------

Although the rosdistro format is most closely associated with the
building of Debian packages, it is actually much more general.  The
rosdistro format is a machine-readable specification of the software
in a ROS distribution, how to access the source code for it, and the
version information.  The information is useful in several toolchains:
build, installation, testing, and documentation.  Variants play a role
in most of these toolchains.

In the build toolchain, variants are used to define Debian
'metapackages'.  In this regard, they can be thought of as ROS 'meta
stacks': they associate libraries together.  Similarly, in the installation
toolchain, the variants are used as entrypoint for users.  

There are two main installation toolchains: the Debian apt-get system
and rosinstall.  The apt-get system has a built-in model for ensuring
dependencies are installed.  rosinstall is currently agnostic to the
code it installs: it does not know it is installing a stack, a
package, or arbitrary code; it has no dependency information.

The testing toolchain is used to provide continuous integration of the
software in the distribution as it is developed.  Variants are
currently not used here, though they may be used in the future to
provide scoping for tests.  ROS stacks are currently tested against
every stack that depends on them.  Popular stacks suffer from
over-testing and also are the slowest to test as a result.

There are currently no plans to use variants in the documentation
(rosdoc, wiki) toolchain.  They could be used for categorization, but
this is speculative.

Within the rosdistro file itself, variants also provide an
organizational role.  One variant can organize stacks together, while
a higher-level variant can "extend" one or more variants to
incorporate these stacks into its own definition.


Specification
=============

End-user entry points
---------------------

We define three main entry points for ROS users:

 * desktop-full (recommended)
 * desktop
 * ros-base

`desktop-full` provides a "batteries included" experience for users.
This is the recommended installation for users as it will enable
novice users to complete most entry tutorials without knowledge of the
underlying library structure.

The `desktop` configuration is more minimal and collects the core
robotics libraries and tools for users to use.

The `ros-base` configuration is an entry point for users wishing to
use a "bare bones" configuration of ROS, such as those on embedded
platforms.

Users may also choose robot-specific entry points, which simplify
configuration when using ROS on a supported hardware platform.  The
definition of these entry points is left to the software maintainers
for those robot platforms.

rosdistro format
----------------

The rosdistro [1]_ format will be upgrade to support `extends` of
multiple variants.  If a variant `extends` another variant, it contains
all of its stacks.  For example::

  - desktop:
      extends: [ros-full, robot, viz]

This new feature will better enable composition for higher-level
variants.

Variant completeness
--------------------

Variants in Diamondback are required to be complete with respect to
stack dependencies.  If a variant contains stack A, and stack A
depends on stack B, then stack B must be in the variant or in one of
the `extends` variants.

Completeness can be tested with the variant_dependencies.py tool
in the rosdistro package.

::

    rosrun rosdistro variant_dependencies.py <distro>

Variants
--------

ROS variants
''''''''''''

The `ros-base` variant composes the `ros` and `ros_comm` stacks, which
were separated as part of REP 100 [2]_.  This variant is not allowed to
have any GUI dependencies.

::

  - ros-base:
      stacks: [ros, ros_comm]

The `ros-full` variant adds the `rx` and `documentation` stacks,
which provide useful tools that are not necessary for on-robot
operation.

::

  - ros-full:
      extends: ros-base
      stacks: [rx, documentation]

Robot variant
'''''''''''''

The `robot` variant is defined to be core, stable, ROS libraries for
any robot hardware.  It is the "general robotics" libraries of ROS.
It may not contain any GUI dependencies.

::

  - robot:
      extends: [ros-base]
      stacks: [common_msgs, common, diagnostics, driver_common,
        geometry, robot_model, executive_smach]


Capability variants
'''''''''''''''''''

The capability variants organize commonly used libraries that are
specific to a class of robots.  We also define a `simulators` variant
that provides an organizational role for higher-level variants.  We
discourage GUI dependencies in these stacks, if possible.

::

  - mobile:
      extends: [robot]
      stacks: [navigation, slam_gmapping, laser_pipeline,
        perception_pcl]

  - perception:
      stacks: [image_common, image_transport_plugins, image_pipeline,
        laser_pipeline, perception_pcl, vision_opencv]

  - move-arm:
      extends: [robot, viz]
      stacks: [arm_navigation, kinematics, motion_planners,
        motion_planning_common, physics_ode, trajectory_filters,
        perception_pcl, pr2_controllers, control, pr2_mechanism,
        pr2_common]

  - simulators:
      extends: [robot]
      stacks: [simulator_stage, simulator_gazebo, physics_ode,
        visualization_common, rx]
  
  - viz:
      extends: [robot]
      stacks: [visualization_common, visualization, rx, image_common, laser_pipeline,
        executive_smach_visualization, diagnostics_monitors]
  
Desktop variants
''''''''''''''''

The `desktop` variants are main entry points for users.  The
`desktop-full` is a "batteries included" experience for users and
attempts to collect stable, well-documented libraries.  These
libraries may be specific to certain classes of robots, such as mobile
robots, though they are not specific to a particular robot.  The
`desktop` variant is more minimal and only provides the stacks in the
`robot` variant, plus visualization and debugging tools.  Both of these
variants contain tutorials for the stacks they provide.

::

  - desktop:
      extends: [ros-full, robot, viz]
      stacks: [ros_tutorials, common_tutorials, geometry_tutorials,
        visualization_tutorials]
  - desktop-full:
      extends: [desktop, mobile, perception, simulators]
  

Institution-specific
''''''''''''''''''''

This REP also proposes the addition of institution-specific variants.
Institution-specific variants must have the name of the institution to
clearly identify them.  The best practice recommendation is to use the
name of the institution's ros-pkg repository, e.g. "wg-ros-pkg".

An institution is not required to have a variant, and they are mainly
provided for convenience and identity.

Robot-specific
''''''''''''''

Robot-specific variants may be defined.  These robot-specific variants
may be used to define both on-robot and off-robot (developer/end-user)
configurations.  At the time of this document, it is expected there
will be variants for the Willow Garage PR2 and Fraunhofer IPA
Care-O-bot, though more may be added during the Diamondback lifecycle.

For the sake of best practices, we enumerate the PR2-specific variants
below, though their specific contents are not considered within the
scope of this REP.  

::

  - pr2-base:
      extends: [mobile, perception, move-arm]
      stacks: [control, object_manipulation, robot_calibration, point_cloud_perception,
        pr2_common, pr2_controllers, pr2_mechanism, web_interface, pr2_calibration,
        pr2_navigation, pr2_kinematics, pr2_arm_navigation, pr2_object_manipulation,
        pr2_tabletop_manipulation_apps, ros_realtime, tabletop_object_perception, sql_database,
        geometry_experimental]
  - pr2:
      extends: [pr2-base]
      stacks: [pr2_robot, pr2_ethercat_drivers, pr2_power_drivers, camera_drivers, imu_drivers,
        joystick_drivers, laser_drivers, linux_networking, sound_drivers, wifi_drivers]
  - pr2-desktop:
      extends: [desktop-full, pr2-base]
      stacks: [pr2_gui, pr2_simulator, pr2_power_drivers, pr2_ethercat_drivers, geometry_visualization]
  - pr2-applications:
      extends: [pr2, viz]
      stacks: [pr2_apps, pr2_common_actions, pr2_doors, pr2_navigation_apps, pr2_plugs,
        pr2_self_test, navigation_experimental]


Rationale
=========

Completeness of Variants
------------------------

Variant completeness is currently necessary due to rosinstall.  As
rosinstall is not aware of stack dependencies, it does not compute the
transitive closure of dependencies for a stack.  We anticipate
upgrading rosinstall or the rosinstall-generation tools to compute
this dependency information.  This completeness constraint can be
relaxed after this occurs.

On-robot vs. off-robot
----------------------

The variants have been defined to enable on-robot vs. off-robot
configurations.  The main distinction between these configurations is
the inclusion of GUI tools, which can be very heavyweight and
unnecessary on the robot itself.  Also, we have found it desirable to
remove GUI tools from robots to prevent users from accidentally
running them there.

Tutorials
---------

Tutorials are included in the `desktop` variants to provide a seamless
experience for new users.  In the past, new users have been confused
by the extra steps necessary for installing tutorials.  

Removal of stacks from variants
-------------------------------

The C Turtle variants attempted to include most stacks within a
variant.  A notable example of this was the very inclusive `pr2all`
variant.  The `pr2all` variant was very volatile as its name implied
that any PR2-related stack had to be added to it.  This instability
creates confusion for both developers and end users.  For Diamondback,
we have attempted to exclude unstable stacks from variants as it is
simple to install these stacks separately.

Similarly, several stacks, such as driver stacks, have little value as
drivers are tied to a specific hardware platform.  We instead
recommend that driver stacks only be included in variants that are
robot specific.

`robot` vs. `base`
------------------

C Turtle used the term `base` for general robotics libraries.  We have
chosen to abandon this term as the `base` variant had grown to contain
many stacks, both GUI and non-GUI, as well as drivers.  There is no
equivalent variant in the Diamondback that contains the same set of
stacks.  For example, drivers are now only included in robot-specific
variants.

There is a now a variant called `robot`, which has a similar semantic
role but is far more limited in scope than the `base` variant.  The
`robot` variant contains stacks that are broadly useful robotics
libraries, such as coordinate transform libraries and higher-level ROS
concepts, like actions.  Hardware-specific robot libraries and tools,
such as GUI displays, have been moved to other variants.  The goal of
the `robot` variant is to remain small as it defines a minimum
footprint of libraries for using ROS for robotics.  Thus, it is also
serves as a useful target to support when porting ROS to other
platforms.


`pr2all`
--------

The variant has been removed as the PR2 software ecosystem is now too
large for it to be easily defined.  It was also frequently being used
in non-PR2 configurations as it was often used to deploy more general
research libraries.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

The rosdistro format will be upgraded to support `extends` of multiple
variants.  As a result, old rosdistro libraries will not be able to
read the new format.  This is not expected to have a big impact as
there are a limited number of rosdistro files.  The Box Turtle release
will no longer be supported after the Diamondback release, so there
will be no effort to upgrade its separate toolchain.
